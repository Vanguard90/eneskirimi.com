		<div><p>This data reflects not only the way people eat. It also other factors - such as lifestyle. However, food plays a very important role. Besides being part of our daily life, we need to eat in order to survive.</p></div>
		<div><img src=""></div>
		<div><p>If we want to eat healthier options, going to the supermarket can be a quite challenging experience. Everything that's not good for us seems to be more appealing either by the way it looks or how the package looks (this is marketing at its best). As the saying goes, "don´t judge a book by its cover." </p>

		<h2 class="revealer">So what can you do?</h2>
		<div class="stat-section2 first-child">
		<div class="text-section"><h3>Choose Local</h3>
		<p>If you are looking for fresh fruits and vegetables, then buy local products. By doing this you will be also helping the farmers in your area as well as the environment! Besides this, instead of going to the freezer section to find meat or fish, try to go more often to the fish market or to the butcher shop.</p></div><div class="image-section"><img src="img/teaser-2/icon-local-products-l.jpg"></div></div>
		</div>
		<div class="stat-section2">
		<div class="text-section flex-order-high"><h3>Choose Organic</h3><p>Do you really want to pay for food that was grown using chemical fertilizers and pesticides? Or would you rather pay for quality? This is what happens when you choose organic: it is an investment in your health and well-being. Organic produce might not be so appealing because of its size and shape, but after you taste it you will not want anything else!</p></div><div class="image-section flex-order-low"><img src="img/teaser-2/organic-logo-l.jpg"></div></div>
		<div class="stat-section2">
		<div class="text-section"><h3>Choose Seasonal </h3><p>Nature is so wise. It gives us what our body needs according to the season. For example, have you ever noticed that there is always more fruit available during summer time? Fruit hydrates us and has also a cooling effect on our body, perfect for that time of the year!</p></div class="image-section"><div><img src="img/teaser-2/choose-seasonal-l.jpg"></div></div>
		<div class="stat-section2">
		<div class="text-section flex-order-high"><h3>Choose Whole</h3><p>Whole grains are slow-absorption carbohydrates and nutritionally more complete <sup><a href="#source-6">[6]</a></sup>. Most people, however, eat refined carbohydrates. But did you know that white flour acidifies the body, taking away minerals <sup><a href="#source-7">[7]</a></sup>? Furthermore, food with a high glycemic value (e.g., refined flour products and also sugar), can act as opium does in our brains, which is why for some people it can be addictive, according to research conducted by Dr. Kathleen DesMaisons, specialist in nutrition and addiction <sup><a href="#source-8">[8]</a></sup>.</p></div><div class="image-section flex-order-low"><img src="img/teaser-2/whole-food-l.jpg"></div></div>
		<div class="stat-section2">
		<div class="text-section"><h3>Choose without Sugar </h3><p>When I use the term "sugar" I mean sucrose that enters very quickly in the bloodstream, disturbing the sugar levels in the blood. In long term, refined sugar increases fatigue and steals from the body minerals and B complex vitamins <sup><a href="#source-7">[7]</a></sup>. But, of course, everybody loves eating a sweet thing! Fruit contains fructose and can be one of the best options available.</p></div><div class="image-section"><img src="img/teaser-2/no-sugar-l.jpg"></div></div>
		<div class="stat-section2">
		<div class="text-section flex-order-high"><h3>Choose Unprocessed</h3><p>Packaged food offers convenience But next time you buy it, read the label. Do you understand the ingredients or are they too hard to spell? Rule of thumb: if you can´t spell them, then put the package back on the supermarket shelf. Besides this, keep in mind that the less ingredients a product has, the better.</p></div><div class="image-section flex-order-low"><img src="img/teaser-2/raw-food-icon-l.jpg"></div></div>
		<div class="stat-section2">
		<div class="text-section"><h3>Choose Diverse </h3><p>Eating a bit of everything is probably the best option if you want to have a balanced diet. However, it is important to take into account certain factors such as the season we are in, as written above, and our personal characteristics like age, sex, lifestyle and what our organism reacts to certain foods, so listen to your body!</p></div><div class="image-section"><img src="img/teaser-2/choose-diverse-l.jpg"></div></div>
