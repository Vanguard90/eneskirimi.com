		<h1>A Quick Guide to Healthy Food Choices</h1>
		<p>Nowadays we have access to everything. In fact, we can eat almost anything at any time, but does this mean we are eating better?</p>
		</div>
		<h2>Let´s look at some facts. In the United States:</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Nearly 38% of adults are obese (1) </li>
			<li>9,3% of the population has diabetes (2) </li>
			<li>About 29% of adults have high blood pressure (3) </li>
			<li>The No. 1 cause of death for both men and women is heart disease (4) </li>
			<li>1 in every 20 deaths is caused by stroke (5)</li>
		</ul>

		<div><p>This data reflects not only the way people eat, of course, but also other factors such as lifestyle. However, food plays a very important role. Besides being part of our daily life, we need to eat in order to survive.</p></div>

		<div><p>If we want to eat healthier options, going to the supermarket can be quite a challenging experience. Why? Because everything that is not good for us seems to be more appealing either by the way it looks or how the package looks (this is marketing at its best). As the saying goes, "don´t judge a book by its cover." </p>

		<h2>So what can you do?</h2>
		<div>
		<h3>Choose Local</h3>
		<p>If you are looking for fresh fruits and vegetables, then buy local products. By doing this you will be also helping the farmers in your area as well as the environment! Besides this, instead of going to the freezer section to find meat or fish, try to go more often to the fish market or to the butcher shop.</p>
